## What Is Prior Art?

**Prior art** refers to evidence that an invention or idea was publicly disclosed before a certain date. In patent law and intellectual property, establishing prior art can:

1. Prevent others from patenting the same idea
2. Establish authorship and origination
3. Create a public record of innovation
4. Protect the original creator's rights

**This repository serves as timestamped proof** of the MyMirror Platform's architectural concepts.

## Architectural Concepts Claimed as Prior Art

### 1. Browser-Based AI Execution Vessel

**Claim:** A secure autonomous AI system where the **browser serves as the primary security boundary** and execution vessel for all AI components.

**Novel Elements:**
- AI operates entirely within browser constraints
- Browser enforces permissions, not the OS
- All components sandboxed within browser process space
- No component can override browser enforcement

**Prior Art Date:** January 13, 2025

---

### 2. Seven-Governor Memory Architecture

**Claim:** A memory system with **seven independent governors**, each managing distinct memory domains with separate access policies and lifecycle rules.

**Novel Elements:**
- Seven specific memory domains with distinct purposes
- Governor 7 (Meta-Memory) observes other governors
- No component has access to all governors
- Predictive retrieval based on context, frequency, temporal, and causal factors

**Prior Art Date:** January 13, 2025

---

### 3. Self-Dissolving Autonomous Agents

**Claim:** Autonomous agents that are **scoped, temporary, non-persistent, and self-dissolving** by architectural design.

**Novel Elements:**
- Agents automatically terminate upon task completion
- No persistent agent state outside governed memory
- Agent lifecycle doctrine enforced by architecture
- Mirrors biological principles of temporary intelligence

**Prior Art Date:** January 13, 2025

---

### 4. Recursive Self-Observing AI System

**Claim:** An AI system with **recursive self-validation** that checks its own integrity against architectural rules, including validation of the validation system itself.

**Novel Elements:**
- Three layers of validation (architectural, behavioral, meta-rules)
- Self-Check validates itself recursively
- Convergence to known-good state as termination condition
- Continuous integrity monitoring

**Prior Art Date:** January 13, 2025

---

### 5. Harmonic Pattern Sampling for AI Systems

**Claim:** A pattern extraction layer using **harmonic frequency ratios** and **temporal coherence** to identify system behavior patterns.

**Novel Elements:**
- Harmonic ratios (1:1, 1:2, 2:3, 3:4, 3:5) applied to AI behavior
- Multi-scale temporal coherence detection
- Non-invasive observation providing signals to simulation
- Pattern extraction without causal assumption

**Prior Art Date:** January 13, 2025

---

### 6. Progressive Disclosure Engine for AI

**Claim:** An information access control system that **progressively discloses information** based on trust, context, and necessity.

**Novel Elements:**
- Five disclosure levels (No Access to Full Content)
- Trust ∧ Context ∧ Necessity formula for disclosure decisions
- Default deny with explicit allow
- All disclosure decisions audited

**Prior Art Date:** January 13, 2025

---

### 7. Predictive Simulation-Driven Security

**Claim:** A security system that uses **isolated predictive simulations** to evaluate threats and actions before execution.

**Novel Elements:**
- Four simulation types (Action, Threat, Resource, Interaction)
- Sandboxed simulation prevents interference with real system
- Security Manager uses simulation results for threat assessment
- Proactive rather than reactive security

**Prior Art Date:** January 13, 2025

---

### 8. Dual-Observation Architecture

**Claim:** Separate **Screen Observer** (external output) and **Self-Observer** (internal behavior) components for comprehensive system monitoring.

**Novel Elements:**
- Screen Observer: Surface-level visual output only
- Self-Observer: Internal metrics and component interactions
- Neither observer can modify what it observes
- Observers feed Harmonic Sampler for pattern extraction

**Prior Art Date:** January 13, 2025

---

### 9. Stateless Host Bridge for AI Systems

**Claim:** A **zero-intelligence, stateless bridge** between AI system and host OS with whitelist-only permissions.

**Novel Elements:**
- Termux Bridge has no decision-making capability
- Completely stateless operation
- Whitelist-only host access
- All operations require orchestrator authorization

**Prior Art Date:** January 13, 2025

---

### 10. AI Governance Model: Recommend, Not Command

**Claim:** An AI governance architecture where **AI recommends but cannot command** or override enforcement mechanisms.

**Novel Elements:**
- AI can observe, correlate, predict, recommend
- AI cannot override browser enforcement
- Prevents privilege escalation and goal corruption
- Orchestrator makes decisions based on AI recommendations

**Prior Art Date:** January 13, 2025
